global variables: 
				STACK:	A, B, C (TO TRANSFER ELEMENTS FROM STACK A TO C)
				INTEGER:	COUNT(TO STORE THE NUMBER OF STEPS
VARIABLES:
				INTEGER:N(TO STORE SIZE)



step-1: user INPUTS N

step-2: numbers from 1-N are filled in stack A

step-3: stack A, stack B, stack C and N are set as parameters for the function "solution"

step-4: Solution INCREMENTS COUNT by 1 and calls the function "solution" again with parameters A,C,B,N-1 to get numbers 1 to N-1 in stack B

step-6: once stack b is returned with values 1 to N-1, N is sent to stack C and stack A is emptied and COUNT is incremented by 1

step-7:then "solution" is called again with parameters B,A,C,N-1

STEP-8:When the values are returned 1-N are already present in stack c number of steps taken to get this solution is stored in global variable COUNT.
